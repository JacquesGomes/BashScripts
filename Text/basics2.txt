head -n 5 (argument to display only the first n lines of information) filename 

ls -R -F = -F more details, -R recursive show a lot of info

head -n or tail -n +number will start the lines at the number, from the starting selected point

man tail or man head gives a detailed description of the command

head and tail works with rows

cut works with columns

cut -f 2-5,8 -d , values.csv = 2 to 5 and 8 using comma as the separator. -f = specify columns and -d to specify the separator

!something re-runs the command
history command will give a list of history with numbers, running !+the number re-runs the command

tail and head print rows, cut print columns and grep print by content

grep incisor namefile (finds the lines in the file with the name specified): useful flags: 
-c: print a count of matching lines rather than the lines themselves
-h: do not print the names of files when searching multiple files
-i: ignore case (e.g., treat "Regression" and "regression" as matches)
-l: print the names of files that contain matches, not the matches
-n: print line numbers for matching lines
-v: invert the match, i.e., only show lines that don't match

-----------------------------------------------------------
head -n 5 seasonal/summer.csv

Instead of sending head's output to a file, add a vertical bar and the tail command without a filename:

head -n 5 seasonal/summer.csv | tail -n 3

cut -d , -f 1 text.txt | grep -v Tooth | head -n 1

head -n 5 text.txt | tail -n 3

wc = word count; flags: -c -w -l = char, word, line

grep someword text.txt | wc -w

replacing the re-naming of files: cut -d , -f 1 text.txt text1.txt ...

can be: cut -d , -f 1 dir/*.txt or dir/* etc cut -d , -f 1 dir/te*.txt

* wild cards

? matches a single character, so 201?.txt will match 2017.txt or 2018.txt, but not 2017-01.txt;
[...] matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets, so 201[78].txt matches 2017.txt or 2018.txt, but not 2016.txt;
{...} matches any of the comma-separated patterns inside the curly brackets, so {*.txt, *.csv} matches any file whose name ends with .txt or .csv, but not files whose names end with .pdf;

sort -r = sort in reverse alphabetical order
-n = numericaly; -b = ignore leading blanks; -f be case insensitive

uniq = remove duplicate adjacent lines

cut -d , -f 2 seasonal/winter.csv | grep -v Tooth | sort | uniq -c

wc-l seasonal/*.csv

wc -l seasonal/*.csv | grep -v total

wc -l seasonal/*.csv | grep -v total | sort -n | head -n 1

set | grep HISTFILESIZE = 2000

echo $variable

assign variable = simply write a name and = something

for filetype in gif jpg png; do echo $filetype; done
it produces:

gif
jpg
png

for $variable in list ; do ... ; done

datasets=seasonal/*.csv

for filename in $datasets; do echo $filename; done

dataset=seasonal/*.csv
for file in $dataset; do grep 2017-07 $file | tail -n 1; done

its possible to separate commands in a loop with semicolons: for filename in $dataset; do head -n 1 $filename; tail -n 1 $filename; done

nano text.txt = iniciar editor nano -> crtl + O para salvar + enter; crtl + X exit


copying thing to home = cp seasonal/s* ~

grep -h -v Tooth s*.csv > temp.csv

history | tail -n 3 > steps.txt

bash file.sh = ./file.sh + chmod +x

nano serves to edit also

$@ = any argument sent
